# 3d-objects

## Description

_Duration: ongoing_

This project is mainly for me to learn how to make 3d images with some of the @react-three libraries. Most of what this app does is fairly simple as its primary purpose is to test things before adding them into larger projects. If you decide to duplicate this project and search other projects online there are multiple depreciated libraries that have a @react-three equivalent. Before importing other 3d libraries, check to see if @react-three has an equivalent library

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start` in your terminal
3. The `npm run start` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
